Typewriter is a tool for mobile content development where extensive information and cautionary text is required on the model. A similar approach is to apply this text with an alpha channel using an image editing tool like Photoshop or GIMP. Although this method may increase the polygon budget, it can result in sharper font rendering while maintaining a lower texture budget.

The initial character set includes a mixture of Turkish and English characters. While non-alphanumeric symbols such as ?, #, !, and | are used, not all are included in the current version of the script.

The files provided with the script are essential for its proper operation, so they should be kept in the same directory as the script.

VSAssignPro is repurposed from an older script for quick testing. It assigns vertex colors to selected editable poly objects, allowing the text color of the generated objects to be changed.

TypeWriter.png is the main bitmap where the generated material is drawn using the alpha channel.

The .psd file is for changing fonts or the alphabet. After modifying the file, it must be exported as a .png with the alpha channel preserved, ensuring the file retains its original name.
